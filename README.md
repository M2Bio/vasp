# Virtual Screening Automation Platform

- Objective: Develop an automated pipeline for molecular docking, starting from a list of compounds to ranking potential leads.
- Skills Learned: Automation (Snakemake, Nextflow), molecular docking tools (AutoDock, PyMOL), and cheminformatics.
- Pharma Relevance: High-throughput virtual screening for drug discovery.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Docker container
- [ ] Snakemake pipeline
  - [ ] AutoDock Vina
- [ ] IO and pre-processing
- [ ] Scoring of docking results
